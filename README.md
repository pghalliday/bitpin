Hardware bitcoin wallet system using deterministic wallets generated by an offline widget for use-once with online companion app

To run tests
------------

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install node dependencies

```
cd /vagrant
npm install
```

### Each time

```
node test
```

This will

- compile the `test.hex` image
- start simduino
- load the `test.hex` image so that it runs immediately
- read the results from the serial port
- exit using the number of test failures as the exit code

To build the `test.hex` and `main.hex` images
---------------------------------------------

```
cd /vagrant
make
```

To run the application
----------------------

In one terminal

```
cd /opt/simavr-1.1/examples/board_simduino
./obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/simduino.elf
```

In another terminal you have a few seconds to run

```
cd /vagrant
avrdude -p m328p -c arduino -P /tmp/simavr-uart0 -U flash:w:build/main.hex
```

The will load the hex image into simduino and run it
